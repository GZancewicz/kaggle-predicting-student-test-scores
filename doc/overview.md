# Predicting Student Test Scores

**Playground Series - Season 6 Episode 1**

## Overview

Welcome to the 2026 Kaggle Playground Series! We plan to continue in the spirit of previous playgrounds, providing interesting and approachable datasets for our community to practice their machine learning skills, and anticipate a competition each month.

**Your Goal:** Predict students' test scores.

## Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated using the **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** between the predicted and the observed target.

## Submission File

For each ID in the test set, you must predict a probability for the `exam_score` variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
id,exam_score
630000,97.5
630001,89.2
630002,85.5
etc.
```

## Timeline

| Milestone | Date |
|-----------|------|
| Start Date | January 1, 2026 |
| Entry Deadline | January 31, 2026 |
| Team Merger Deadline | January 31, 2026 |
| Final Submission Deadline | January 31, 2026 |

All deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC on the corresponding day unless otherwise noted. The competition organizers reserve the right to update the contest timeline if they deem it necessary.

## About the Tabular Playground Series

The goal of the Tabular Playground Series is to provide the Kaggle community with a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. The duration of each competition will generally only last a few weeks, and may have longer or shorter durations depending on the challenge.

## Synthetically-Generated Datasets

The dataset for this Playground competition was generated synthetically from a deep learning model. We use synthetic data to create a fun, beginner-friendly "sandbox" where we can provide interesting datasets with named features while keeping the test labels private.

**Please Note:** While our generation techniques have improved over years, synthetic data is not a perfect replica of the real world. You may encounter "artifacts"—patterns or correlations that do not exist in reality—and slight gaps between the synthetic and original distributions. Our goal is to provide a high-quality learning experience, and we rely on your feedback to help us close the gap between synthetic and real data in future competitions.
